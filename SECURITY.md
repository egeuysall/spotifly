## Security

Security is a top priority for Spotifly. As you work with or contribute to this project, here are some best practices and guidelines to follow:

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Sanitize User Input**: Always sanitize and validate user input to prevent common attacks like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all communications between the client and the server are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Secure Authentication**: Use secure methods for authentication, such as OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or other secure mechanisms. Avoid storing plain-text passwords.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (in your databases).

### Vulnerability Management
- **Regular Dependency Audits**: Periodically audit third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known security issues.
- **Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries and dependencies up-to-date to ensure that you benefit from the latest security patches.
  
### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in Spotifly, please report it responsibly. You can submit an issue or send a direct message to the project maintainer. Please refrain from disclosing vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

### Best Practices for Developers
- **Environment Variables**: Do not hard-code sensitive credentials in your source code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store secrets and keys.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access control to limit user permissions and avoid privilege escalation.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure that your application and database are regularly backed up to minimize data loss in case of an incident.
- **Logging**: Log all critical events, such as failed login attempts or unusual activity, but ensure that sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) is not logged.

By adhering to these security practices, you help ensure that Spotifly remains secure and resilient against attacks.
